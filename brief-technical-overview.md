#### a brief technical overview of cobudget

we can think of cobudget as an internal crowdfunding app for groups with shared purpose

- `users` can have many `groups`, through `memberships`

- within a `group`:

  - `users` create `buckets` (buckets is our affectionate name for projects a person is seeking funding for)

  - `buckets` progress through stages:

    - **draft**: ideation stage. bucket proposal is co-formulated through feedback + discussion

    - **live**: funding stage. users can contribute money to the bucket

    - **funded**: final stage. after a bucket is funded, the bucket's author continuously reports back on its progress.

  - `users` discuss / give feedback on `buckets` via `comments`

  - `users` fund `buckets` via `contributions`

  - `users` receive money to fund `buckets` with, from an admin, via `allocations`

- `users` receive notification emails of recent activity in their `groups`. they choose what activity they want to be notified of and how often they want to be notified of it via their `subscription tracker`
